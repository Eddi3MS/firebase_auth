# firebase_auth
Simple auth system with firebase, with token handling

## To use it:

- use yarn / npm install to download dependencies
- create a project in firebase + activate auth by email/password + save your api key for later.
- create a .env
- create a variable called REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY
- assign your firebase api key to it

You're good to go.
